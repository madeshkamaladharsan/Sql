1) Retrieve the customer(s) with the highest account balance.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     ORDER BY balance DESC
                     LIMIT 1);
2) Calculate the average account balance for customers who have more than one account.
SELECT AVG(balance)
FROM Accounts
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id
                      FROM Accounts
                      GROUP BY customer_id
                      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
3) Retrieve accounts with transactions whose amounts exceed the average transaction amount.
SELECT *
FROM Accounts
WHERE account_id IN (SELECT account_id
                     FROM Transactions
                     GROUP BY account_id
                     HAVING AVG(amount) > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM Transactions));
4) Identify customers who have no recorded transactions.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM Transactions);
5) Calculate the total balance of accounts with no recorded transactions.
SELECT SUM(balance)
FROM Accounts
WHERE account_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT account_id FROM Transactions);
6) Retrieve transactions for accounts with the lowest balance.
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id IN (SELECT account_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     ORDER BY balance ASC
                     LIMIT 1);
7) Identify customers who have accounts of multiple types.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id
                      FROM Accounts
                      GROUP BY customer_id
                      HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT account_type) > 1);
8) Calculate the percentage of each account type out of the total number of accounts.
SELECT account_type, 
       COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Accounts) AS percentage
FROM Accounts
GROUP BY account_type;
9) Retrieve all transactions for a customer with a given customer_id.
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id IN (SELECT account_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     WHERE customer_id = [customer_id]);
10) Calculate the total balance for each account type, including a subquery within the SELECT clause.
SELECT account_type, 
       (SELECT SUM(balance) 
        FROM Accounts 
        WHERE account_type = A.account_type) AS total_balance
FROM Accounts A
GROUP BY account_type;
