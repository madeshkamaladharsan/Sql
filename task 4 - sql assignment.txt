1) Retrieve the customer(s) with the highest account balance.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id = (SELECT customer_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     ORDER BY balance DESC
                     LIMIT 1);
2) Calculate the average account balance for customers who have more than one account.
SELECT AVG(balance)
FROM Accounts
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id
                      FROM Accounts
                      GROUP BY customer_id
                      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

3) Identify customers who have no recorded transactions.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM Transactions);
4) Calculate the total balance of accounts with no recorded transactions.
SELECT SUM(balance)
FROM Accounts
WHERE account_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT account_id FROM Transactions);
5) Retrieve transactions for accounts with the lowest balance.
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id IN (SELECT account_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     ORDER BY balance ASC
                     LIMIT 1);
6) Identify customers who have accounts of multiple types.
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id
                      FROM Accounts
                      GROUP BY customer_id
                      HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT account_type) > 1);

7) Retrieve all transactions for a customer with a given customer_id.
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id = (SELECT account_id
                     FROM Accounts
                     WHERE customer_id = 101);
8) Calculate the total balance for each account type, including a subquery within the SELECT clause.
SELECT account_type, SUM(balance) AS total_balance
(SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Accounts 
        WHERE account_type = A.account_type) 
FROM Accounts 
GROUP BY account_type;
